# Demo Forms

## Intro

Each of these forms can be used to quickly test the CHT core's different features. For example, if you 
load the `geopoint` form, you can test the Enketo Geopoint form in your app.

## Loading

The forms can either be loaded in via the web admin GUI or through command line using `medic-conf`
